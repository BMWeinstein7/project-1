Game for Project 1 WDI- Potoo
 -->
 # GA: Project 1
**Name**: War: Potoo Edition

**Rules**:

The rules of war are quite simple. The game is played using a standard deck of 52 cards. The cards are distributed in half to the two competing players, thus each player begins with 26 cards. Once each player has their 26 cards, faced down, they flip their top card over and compare their card to their opponents card. The cards are ranked with an ace being the highest and 2 being the lowest. Upon each turn, whichever player has the higher card wins that round and takes both cards into his or her pile of cards. If the flipped cards are equal, then there is WAR. Up to four cards are drawn from each deck, and the fourth card is compared as normal. The player with the highest card then wins all of the cards. This continues until one player ends up with all of the cards in their possession, and that player is the winner. 

**MVP**: My Minimal Viable Product for this game will include:


- A landing page describing the game WAR
- Webpage for the game laid out with two sets of 26 cards (2 Players)
- A randomizer to randomize the cards in which each player has
- Each user will have the ability to click a button to flip their top card over and display the card
- The game will then test for who has the higher card value.
- The player with the higher card will receive both of those cards
- Player 1 and Player 2 continue to click the flip card button until one player is left with all of the cards, thus making him/her the winner. 
- The game will end when one of the two players is left without any cards. The player with the cards is the winner.

**Goals**: 

- Design a sleek and unique UI for the display of the game board
- Add functionality to randomize the order of the cards in each players possession after each card flip. 
- Create a counter that keeps score of how many cards are currently in each players possession- thus who is currently winning at that time. 
- Fully responsive game
- Refresh game button that restarts the game
- Shuffle Deck button that re-randomizes all the cards dispersed to the two players.
- When there is a “War” - Have a popup alert informing the players of the rules of the war situation, and change the functionality to now disperse four cards and use the last card as the card to evaluate. 
- Upon ending, declare a winner, and ask to play again. 

**Challenges**: 

- Time available to finish a complete game from scratch. 
- Incorporating JQuery correctly
- creating the logic for the event of the cards matching and creating a “war” scenario
- Incorporate a way for each player to have a way to interact with the game rather than one button that flips the cards
- Appealing Design for the landing page and the game page

**Technologies:**

- HTML for Both Pages.
- Vanilla Javascript 
- JQUERY 
- CSS for Styling the game
- Use SublimeText, and Github for writing the code and hosting the code repository. 
- Git commands
