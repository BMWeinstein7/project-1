			<h1> Rules of War </h1>
				<p> The rules of war are quite simple. The game is played using a standard deck of 52 cards. The cards are distributed in half to the two competing players, thus each player begins with 26 cards. Once each player has their 26 cards, faced down, they flip their top card over and compare their card to their opponents card. The cards are ranked with an ace being the highest and 2 being the lowest. Upon each turn, whichever player has the higher card wins that round and takes both cards into his or her pile of cards. If the flipped cards are equal, then there is WAR. Up to four cards are drawn from each deck, and the fourth card is compared as normal. The player with the highest card then wins all of the cards. This continues until one player ends up with all of the cards in their possession, and that player is the winner.
